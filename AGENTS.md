# Project Agent Workflow

## Scope

Phase 0 (MAPIT research, API discovery, and the reusable standalone Python
client), Phase 1 (local read-only MCP core), Phase 2 (route analytics), Phase 3
(the reusable read-only realtime component), and Phase 4 (the local
Codex-to-MCP conversational-agent adapter and deterministic evaluation) are
complete. Phase 5 is ACTIVE only for the private local Telegram prototype
contract, implementation, and offline tests in
`docs/phase-5-telegram-contracts.md`. Do not make Telegram calls, create a bot,
send messages, or use real bot tokens/chat IDs/user IDs until an explicit
external gate authorizes it. Do not expand into an agent UI, frontend, project
database, project-owned AWS infrastructure, webhook deployment, Home Assistant,
or persistence.

MAPIT remains read-only in Phase 5. Do not send `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or
`DELETE` requests to MAPIT except the Cognito calls strictly required for
authentication. The only future Telegram write in the Phase 5 contract is the
bounded `sendMessage` operation, which is not implemented or authorized yet.
Never commit credentials, tokens, AWS keys, Telegram bot tokens, or real
personal/device/location/chat/user IDs.

Before expanding the MCP core, agents, tools, evaluations, or AWS integration,
read:

- `C:\Users\herre\OneDrive\Desktop\herrerogusano's vault\04 Knowledge\AI Engineering\AI Engineering.md`
- the task-relevant guides linked from that index

## Persistent Roles

Reuse these three roles across project phases. Do not create fresh agents for routine
work.

- `researcher`: investigate MAPIT, public implementations, frontend bundles,
  endpoints, payloads, history, and WebSocket behavior. Prefer primary evidence.
- `implementer`: make bounded code changes only after the relevant evidence and
  decisions are documented.
- `tester`: independently review changes, add or run offline tests, and check
  security, error handling, and regression risk.

Preferred worker configuration: `gpt-5.6-luna`, high reasoning. The supervisor
owns scope, sequencing, decisions, integration, and acceptance. Escalate model
effort only for a demonstrated blocker.

Use this normal sequence when practical:

1. Researcher gathers and documents evidence.
2. Supervisor approves a bounded implementation task.
3. Implementer changes code and runs focused tests.
4. Tester reviews and tests independently.
5. Implementer fixes concrete defects; supervisor accepts or rejects.

Each worker report should be brief: Task, Findings, Files changed, Tests, Open
questions, and Supervisor must retain.

## Project Memory

Treat repository documentation as the durable source of truth. Update findings
incrementally, especially:

- `docs/mapit-authentication.md`
- `docs/mapit-endpoints-discovered.md`
- `docs/mapit-data-inventory.md`
- `docs/mapit-routes-investigation.md`
- `docs/phase-0-findings.md`
- `docs/phase-0-status.md`
- `docs/phase-3-status.md`
- `docs/phase-4-agent-contracts.md`
- `docs/phase-5-telegram-contracts.md`
- `docs/phase-5-status.md`

Distinguish confirmed facts, evidence found in frontend/code, hypotheses, and
open questions. Do not invent capabilities or brute-force endpoints.
